### Connect 4 AI

## Introduction

This is a project to develop an AI for playing Connect 4 using the Minimax algorithm, combined with Pygame for a graphical user interface. The goal is to create an AI that can make intelligent decisions when competing against a player or another AI.

## Features

🎮 Play Connect 4 with an intuitive interface using Pygame.

🧠 AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for performance optimization.

🎭 Game modes:

👤 Player vs AI

🤖 AI vs AI

👥 Player vs Player

⚙️ Adjustable AI search depth to modify difficulty level.

## Installation

# Requirements

🐍 Python 3.8 or later

📦 Required libraries:

pip install pygame numpy

Run the game

Clone the repository and run the following command:

python connect4.py

How It Works

🔍 The game uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate the best move.

✂️ Alpha-Beta pruning reduces the number of states to be explored.

📊 A heuristic scoring system is used to evaluate board states.

## Future Improvements

🚀 Enhance the board evaluation algorithm for a stronger AI.

🌐 Support network connectivity for multiplayer matches between computers.

🎨 Improve the user interface with better graphics and animations.
